# Telegram bot - @ujnphotobot
My simple ruby telegram bot for return UJN-students photo

# Requirements
You must have ruby 2.2.0 or 2.3.0 to launch server. Also you have to install requirements via 'gem':
```bash
gem install daemons
gem install telegram-bot-ruby
```
You also have to create token.ini to store you telegram-bot TOKEN

# Launching
To launch telegram bot
```bash
ruby telegram-bot-daemon.rb start
```
If this script deployed in PRC you should use 'proxychains'

# Motivation
I find a API in my school websites but it has always really hard to look. So I decided to solve this problem by developing @ujnphotobot
